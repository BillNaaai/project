            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to E-Shop! These Terms and Conditions outline the rules for using our C2C (customer-to-customer) marketplace platform. By accessing or using our services, you agree to these terms. E-Shop connects buyers and sellers but does not own or sell any of the listed items.</p>
            
            <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>To list items or contact sellers, users must register for an account. You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure and must notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized use of your account.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Listings and Transactions</h2>
            <p>Sellers are solely responsible for the accuracy, legality, and condition of their listings. E-Shop is not a party to transactions. Buyers and sellers must communicate clearly and conduct transactions independently, including arranging payment and delivery methods.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Disputes and Liability</h2>
            <p>Disputes arising from transactions must be resolved directly between the buyer and seller. While we encourage fair conduct, E-Shop is not liable for delivery issues, misrepresentation, or damages arising from user interactions.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Prohibited Activities</h2>
            <p>Users must not post illegal content, violate intellectual property rights, engage in fraudulent activity, or disrupt the platform. We reserve the right to suspend or delete accounts that violate these rules.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We value your privacy. Please refer to our <a href="privacypage.html">Privacy Policy</a> to understand how we collect, use, and protect your data while using the platform.</p>
            
            <h2>7. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may suspend or terminate your account if you breach these terms or misuse the platform. You may also delete your account at any time by contacting our support team.</p>
            
            <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to amend these Terms and Conditions at any time. Continued use of the platform constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms. Please check this page regularly for updates.</p>
